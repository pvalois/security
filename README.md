# security

Since i started root-me, i decided to write some helpers to audit servers.
Not much of a work, of course, but useful nonetheless, and publishing them here makes no harm. 

   - Web

     * urlextact.py    : extract link of interest from an url, in order to build web site analyser/mirrorer/hacker scripts
     * htmlentities.py : a simple html entities decoder, for rewriting purposes in shell script
     * getcookies.py   : like html entities, a one simple purpose script, connect to a page, and print retrieved cookies, useful for session continuity when hacking
     * test-methods.py : a script to test methods supported by a web server

   - Wifi

     * get-ssid.py : extract the sid from a capture of a wifi session 

And to complete my work, some p-o-i on internet :
